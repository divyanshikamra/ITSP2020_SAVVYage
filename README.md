# ITSP2020_SAVVYage

SAVVYage is a socially aware autonomous being made by me and 3 other members of my team. 

This repo contains all the files made by me upto now to comeup with a bot which uses odometry and sensors to localize itself and mapp it's surroundings and move around in the environment planning it's own path.
This is all the progress done as of now. Though we're still working on it, to come up with a better oath planning algorithm and include SLAM in our bot.
